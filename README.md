# Bomberman

### Short project description

This is a project task for "Computer Networks" course at University of Warsaw, the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, 2021/2022. I do not own the idea for this project.

It contains a TCP client for a simple version of a popular game "bomberman".
It also contains a TCP "bomberman" server, but the server is unfinished.
